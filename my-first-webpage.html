      <p>We had a lot of problems as we made this page. But first we had to set some goals for our site.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Set a background.</li>
        <li>Create a transparent div to make our text more legible.</li>
        <li>Move our div to be centered on the page.</li>
        <li class="flashy">Make the text move with the div!</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>How We Fixed It</h2>

      <p>We set the background image to be in the body.</p>
      <p>We struggled with the div a lot, but ended up creating the div, which
        contained all of our body text. We set the background color to the grey that
        we wanted, then we set the opacity to 80% <span class="flashy">(Thanks for the help, friends!)</span>.</p>
      <p>We made two other divs, just to take up space. Each div had a percentage width
        and was set to display: inline-block.</p>
      <p>We're proud of how this turned out!</p>
      <p>But we're most proud of <a href="file:///Users/learn10/Documents/Wld/public/css/boring-webpage.html" alt="Boring Lecture">this</a>!</p>
